Commands GIT:
--------------
Basic commands in git:
 - Clon the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Marvalero/Blueconnect

- After that, you must create a new brach que a name:
    git checkout -b namebranch
    git push origin namebranch

- After tath, you could open the project with Android Studio and modify it. You could commit changes with:
    git add .
    git commit -m "What you have done"
    git pull
    git push

- Whe you want to do a merge request to master branch: 
   git merge origin/master
  ** And you must wait until Marvalero has read the changes and confirm your request

- When a merge request is accepted, the others have to do:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Aqui poneis un comentario que diga lo que habeis hecho"
    git push
    git pull origin master

- It's good to make a "git pull" sometimes :)
